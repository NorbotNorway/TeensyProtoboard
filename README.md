# TeensyProtoboard
A Teensy breakout card

Makes it easy to do prototyping with the Teensy (3.1/3.2).

All pins are broken out to separate headers. The outermost headers are GND, the middle are +5V, and the inner (closes to Teensy) are datapins.

There is a Power-LED, and a RX and TX LED for displaying serial communication.
